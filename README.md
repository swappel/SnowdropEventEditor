This project is currently under heavy development and is subject to intense changes during this time. Not many features are available yet, but this will quickly change, as work continues on this project.

## What is planned for this project in the future:

### Supported files:
We plan on supporting as many file formats as possible in one single tool, so the optimal would be if all the Snowdrop file formats would be supported.

### Features:
We plan on making this project as adapted to the snowdrop files as possible. So the features may become many in the comming time.
